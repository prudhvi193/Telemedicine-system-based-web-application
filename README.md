# Telemedicine
Project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon Competition in 2018 for the Minsitry of Health and Family Welfare

Java Based Web Application for implementing a telemedicine system.

Summary of the Project:
      The aim of this project was to develop an web based telemedicine system for people in rural areas under a lower bandwidth connection. This application mainly would consist an interface which explains about the details of the application and its usage. Also this application specifies some static information about the general diseases that frequently occur and their precautions and prescriptions to be followed as suggested by the government medical hosipitals and this data was provided by the Medical Government Agency in India.
      
      Also the main focus of this application is to establish a communication between the supervised doctors in the urban areas and the government doctors in the rural areas through the use of an integrated bot and a 3rd party open source video conferencing application called as WebRTC. Throughout India there exists a government hospital for each rural area and also a licensed doctor who runs that hospital.
      
      ]The intial steps every doctor needs to do is to register as a member in the particular website based on his/her issued license number and also their area of specializations that they can handle. Based on this we can obtain the data of all the doctors throughout the country who are working in the rural areas and also apart from it we also obtain information of the doctors working in urban aread who work for the private hospitals and can provide all the necessary requirements if there are any serious issues faced by the patients.
      
      So, a simple example on how this application functions is whenever a patient is facing an issue he/she moves to the local government hospital and registers about the problem they have and they are served accordingly based on the symptomps the patient has and if it is complicated for the doctor to cure the patient, then he/she can contact through a video chat to the doctors in the urban areas who are registered under the website and can get the immediate required treatment also the prescriptions needed to the cure. Also the patient hitory is registered so that this can help doctors in any area to know if there is a similar case that has taken place before and get the necessary results required to suggest the precautions needed for the patient.
      
      On an end note, this application basically saves the money for the poor and also reduces their travel cost to the cities. For developing this application to be used under low bandwidth situations we had kept the graphical user interface much simpler and also easier to use for both the doctors and the patients. The major complexity was to manage the constraints bandwidth related to the integrated chatbot and video calling which we could overcome by using a medium quality screen resolution between 480p to 720p.
